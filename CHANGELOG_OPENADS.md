# OpenADS specific changes

## General

- Support the CARLA ROS 2 native interface via the [`native_interface`](./docs/run_ros.md) launch argument. When enabled, native CARLA sensor publishers are used and bridge-side sensor actors are skipped where possible.
- Bump the supported CARLA version to [0.10.0](./carla_ros_bridge/src/carla_ros_bridge/CARLA_VERSION) using Unreal Engine 5 and the corresponding Python API updates.
- Use a [`SingleThreadedExecutor`](./carla_ros_bridge/src/carla_ros_bridge/bridge.py) for the bridge node. The CARLA world tick already runs in a separate thread, so a `MultiThreadedExecutor` can conflict with the tick/update flow.

## Timing Related

- Support real-time control by decoupling CARLA ticking from ROS callback processing in the bridge.
- Add [`start_unix_time_stamp`](./docs/run_ros.md) to offset ROS simulation timestamps or start them from the current Unix time.
- Allow disabling bridge-side `/clock` publishing when the CARLA native interface provides time synchronization.
- Support [`use_sim_time`](./docs/run_ros.md) consistently across bridge, spawning, and control nodes.

## Map Related

- Rename `frame_id` from `map` to `carla_map`
- Publish a static transform from the OpenDRIVE georeferenced UTM frame to `carla_map`; the georeference can also be overridden through [`georeference_substitution`](./docs/run_ros.md).
- Apply grid-convergence correction for projected map frames where needed, with override support through [`grid_convergence`](./docs/run_ros.md).

## Transform Related

- Add [`ignore_altitude`](./docs/run_ros.md) to flatten altitude in TF, odometry, GNSS, and object-list outputs where supported.
- Add [`ignore_tilt`](./docs/run_ros.md) to suppress pitch and roll while preserving yaw in pseudo TF, odometry, IMU, and object-list pose outputs.
- Let [`carla_spawn_objects`](./carla_spawn_objects/README.md) own the [transform](./docs/ros_sensors.md#sensor-transforms) of sensors whose absolute pose misrepresents them: a sensor spawned without a parent actor that sits in a group or at a ground-relative altitude. It is spawned with the CARLA `no_transform` attribute and its static transform is published relative to the enclosing group. Every other sensor keeps the server-side transform. Can be overridden per sensor through `no_transform`.

## Spawning Related

- Add automatic spawn altitude correction for maps with elevation.
- Extend [`carla_spawn_objects`](./carla_spawn_objects/README.md) with `group` and `blueprint` placeholders to spawn a specific vehicle and its sensor equipment in a reproducible setup.
- Add WGS84/global spawn point support for object definitions; spawn points can use `lat`/`lon` in addition to CARLA `x`/`y` coordinates.
- Add [ground-relative spawn altitudes](./docs/ros_sensors.md#ground-relative-spawn-altitude) for sensor and group definitions; spawn points can use `alt_above_ground`/`z_above_ground` to place an object at a height above the terrain instead of at an absolute altitude. The property is inherited by all `children` and keeps the object's transform ground-relative, which stays consistent with `ignore_altitude`. The ground altitude is taken from the OpenDRIVE map and looked up once per group, and `alt_ground`/`z_ground` can state a known ground altitude to replace the lookup altogether. Vehicles and walkers are not supported and are rejected with an error.

## Sensor Related

- Add optional compressed image publishing for cameras via [`publish_compressed_images`](./docs/run_ros.md).
- Optionally include static map objects in object-list output.
- Add an [Ideal Object Sensor](./docs/ros_sensors.md#ideal-object-sensor), which detects vehicles and walkers by range, field of view, bounding-box vertices, and optional occlusion checks.
- Add ETSI MAPEM/SPATEM conversion for traffic-light and junction information in the [Traffic Lights Sensor](./docs/etsi_its_conversion.md).
- Prevent similar sensor names and thus duplicated topics
- Add `/carla/weather` publishing and `/carla/weather_control` handling for CARLA weather parameters.

## Controlling

- Disable automated control commands while manual control is active.
- Add Xbox wireless controller support to [manual control](./carla_manual_control/src/carla_manual_control/carla_manual_control.py).
- Use [`AckermannDriveStamped`](./docs/carla_ackermann_control.md) instead of `AckermannDrive` for Ackermann control input.

## Misc

- Disable CARLA hard version checks
- Add [`docker-ros`](github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/docker-ros) CI pipeline support.
